    <h2 class="about-h2">Hi, I'm Vidya 👋</h2>
    <p class="about-p1">A passionate Web Developer creating modern, user-friendly web applications.</p>
    <p class="about-p">I am a motivated and hardworking fresher with a strong interest in web development and modern frontend technologies.  
I enjoy creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.  
I also have knowledge of Core Java, SQL, and basic programming concepts that help me understand how real applications work.

I love learning new tools and improving my skills through hands-on projects.  
Every project I build teaches me something new and helps me become a better developer.

I am now looking for an opportunity where I can apply my skills, grow professionally, and contribute to meaningful projects with dedication and creativity.
